            <div id="coccoon"><p>Have patience. Forgiveness induces healing which follows
                its own order and timing. Whether you think you have
                accomplished anything thus far is less important than the
                fact that you have attempted a radical act calling forth
                change beyond your imagining. Go about your daily
                business, but stay alert to unexpected shifts in your
                thinking, feelings, and relationships.</p></div>

            <div id="coccoon"><p>Ask for God's help to overcome fear or resistance at any
step. If you do not believe in God, ask for help from all
nature, humanity, and the mysteries of your own mind.
These are the channels through which aid is sent — and
aid is always sent.</p></div>

            <div id="coccoon"><p>Hold in your mind the image of whatever is to be forgiven
                — yourself, another person, a past event — and say,“I release
                you from the grip of my sadness, disapproval, or condemnation." Concentrate quietly on this intention.</p></div>
